    </header><h2>About the Cyberculture and Social Justice Directory</h2>
<p>The Cyberculture and Social Justice Directory is a public directory of the resources assembled by the Just Feminist Tech and Scholarship Lab (https://www.justfeministtechandscholarshiplab.com/), directed by Dr. Alex Ketchum (https://www.alexketchum.ca). 
This directory will always be incomplete and a work in progress. Rather than attempt to capture every resource at the intersections of cyberculture and social justice, the aim of this directory is to assemble resources used by the lab in one place that other people can access. 
It was created as part of Dr. Alex Ketchum’s project exploring the history of reactions to the creation of computers, the Internet, Big Data, and AI technologies by people with a feminist and social justice lens, primarily in Canada and the United States. 
As there is complexity and imprecision in all of these terms (cyberculture, social justice, feminism, AI, and Big Data), creating this directory was an attempt to get a sense of larger trends.
It was important to share the findings so others could benefit from the lab's undertaking and build on this work as it is useful to them. There's no need to keep re-inventing the wheel.</p>
<p>This directory is ever growing, expanding historically and in the future. We aim to include resources found in physical archives. However, this component of the project has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Ketchum's inability to travel to physical archives since Spring 2019.</p>
<p>You can contribute suggestions to the directory, by emailing (email: feministpublishingandtech [at] gmail.com)</p>
<p>Please note that the inclusion of a resource in the directory is not an endorsement of that text, author, or creator. We have included a wide variety of resources that are useful for our historical analysis.</p>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>Thank you to the members of the Just Feminist Tech and Scholarship Lab for your hard work on the markdown sheets. Thank you to Kari Kuo, Zoe Tolon, Thai Hwang J, and Jacqueline Tam. Thank you also to Kari for streamlining our tagging system.
Thank you to Pierre Faniel for your work in writing the scripts to convert the .md files into an actual website.
We have been greatly inspired by Mindy Seu’s amazing Cyberfeminism Index (https://cyberfeminismindex.com/about/). You will notice an overlap of some resources but the projects differ. Thank you to Mindy Seu for creating such a valuable resource and inspiring us to move our project away from Google Sheets and proprietary software.</p>
<p>The creation of this directory was made possible through Ketchum's SSHRC Insight Grant. </p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>To ensure the sustainability of this project, we have made the information available via .md (markdown) plain text files. You can access the markdown sheets at our project's github: <a href="https://github.com/AlexandraDivaKetchum/Cyberculture-and-Social-Justice-Directory">https://github.com/AlexandraDivaKetchum/Cyberculture-and-Social-Justice-Directory</a></p></body>
