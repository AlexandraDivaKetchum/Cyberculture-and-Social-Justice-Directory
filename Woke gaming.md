# Woke Gaming: Digital Challenges to Oppression and Social Injustice
## Kishonna L. Gray and David J. Leonard (eds.)
## 2018

"Woke Gaming examines resistance to problematic spaces of violence, discrimination, and microaggressions in gaming culture. The contributors of these essays seek to identify strategies to detox gaming culture and orient players and gamers toward progressive ends. From Anna Anthropy’s Keep Me Occupied to Momo Pixel’s Hair Nah, video games can reveal the power and potential for marginalized communities to resist, and otherwise challenge dehumanizing representations inside and outside of game spaces." *Summary taken from University of Washingston Press*
