# Engineered for Dystopia
## David A Banks
### 2018

This article traces the connections of the engineering profession historically and presently with authoritarianism, fascism and fundamentalism.  They're desire for a well ordered world, centralized power to create big state structures, and the lack of ethics regulation leaving much up to corporate interest, are all problematic to Banks, and they suggest cultivating the engineering mindset of building things as a form of care, considering other liberal arts and philosophies, and interogating the power structures that engingeering is implicated in.
