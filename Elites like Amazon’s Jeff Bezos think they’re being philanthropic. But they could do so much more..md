# Elites like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos think they’re being philanthropic. But they could do so much more.
## Eric Johnson
### 2018

Johnson explains how very rich "philanthropists" often dedicate money to and pledge their support for causes that they often are guilty of contributing negatively towards - such as global inequalities and climate change, but will never do anything that harms their bottom line - hence the reason why this philanthropy is a charade of the elites. His new book "the elite charade of changing the world" argues that we've normalized and bought into the idea that the rich and powerful have our best interest in mind, when in fact they are interested in preserving the unequal status quo from which they benefit.
