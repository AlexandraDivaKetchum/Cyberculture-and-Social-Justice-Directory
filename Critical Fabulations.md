# Critical Fabulations: Reworking the methods and margins of design
## Daniela K. Rosner
### 2018 

"Daniela Rosner proposes redefining design as investigative and activist, personal and culturally situated, responsive and responsible. Challenging the field's dominant paradigms and reinterpreting its history, Rosner wants to change the way we historicize the practice, reworking it from the inside. Focusing on the development of computational systems, she takes on powerful narratives of innovation and technology shaped by the professional expertise that has become integral to the field's mounting status within the new industrial economy." Draws on the discourse of feminist technoscience. *Summary taken from MIT Press*
