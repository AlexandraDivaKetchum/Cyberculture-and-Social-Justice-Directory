This file shows the markdown style that we will be using for the directory. It is a really easy coding language. 


# Heading 1= Title of the Book, Zine, Pamphlet, or Organization
## Heading 2 = Author Name 
if there are multiple authors, write their names in alphabetical order
if the text is written by a group or organization, use that name
### Heading 3= Date
write only the year-- it is **really** important that you only write the year since this will be important for the way that the information appears on the website
if you do not known the year, you can write c.1970 which means circa 1970
if you have no idea, write n.d. which means no date

This is a sample of how we will write the mark down code for the directory.
We will be writing all of the entries in a single markdown file. 


If you want to create a break between the text, hit enter twice. 

TO make a list begin with the dash- then if you want to do a sublist click indent 
This functions similarly to list making in Microsoft Word

- second time
- third time
  - indented
     1. inner number
    
Here is how we write hyperlinks. You put the description that you want clicked on in the brackets and you then put the url in the parentheses immediately after that

If you want to create italics, use the * on each side of a word
example *italic*

If you want to make the text bold, use the * twice on each side of a word
example **bold**
