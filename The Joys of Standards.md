# The Joys of Standards
## Andrew Russell and Lee Vinse
### 2019

The authors discuss the societal benefits of standardization, and examples of where the creation of standards have been a cooperative process, involving many parties, that worked to forge more coorporation and convenience after the standard was used. They wish to push back on the idea that standardization is stifling, Kafka-esque, mediocre and comformist, as well as push back on the idea that "innovation," newness and reinventing prior standards is inherently good, to show that standards are joyful for the creators and consumers of technology alike.
