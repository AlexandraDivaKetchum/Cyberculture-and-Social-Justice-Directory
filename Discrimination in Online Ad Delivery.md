# Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery
## Latanya Sweeney
### 2013

This study examines how automated ads racially profile certain "black-sounding" names online when suggesting arrest records.  Ie. the author discovered when searching up her own name, Latanya Sweeney, ads that read "Latanya Sweeney, arrested?" showed up because of a) other cases of Latanya's being arrested and b) the fact that searching up the name in google images yields mostly black pictures.  Given that names such as Jill did not suggest such ads despite being present in arrest records, the study suggests that algorithms use the info of racially profiled names to suggest ads to look up the arrest histories of black people unfairly.
