# Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies
## Cait McKinney
### 2020

*Information Activism* traces how feminists from the 1970s to the present developed communication networks, databases, and digital archives as the foundation for their activism. These people had to learn collectively how to archive their work and transition from paper to digital-based archival practices, for example. "McKinney demontrates how groups with precarious access to control over information create their own innovative techniques for generating and sharing knowledge."
