# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power
## Shoshana Zuboff
### 2019 

Zuboff tackles the social, political, business, personal, and technological meaning of "surveillance capitalism" as an unprecedented new market form. It is not simply about tracking us and selling ads, it is the business model for an ominous new marketplace that aims at nothing less than predicting and modifying our everyday behavior-- where we go, what we do, what we say, how we feel, who we're with. She shows that the threat has shifted from a totalitarian "big brother" state to a universal global architecture of automatic sensors and smart capabilities, free from democratic oversight and control.
