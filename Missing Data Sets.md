# Missing Data Sets and On Missing Datasets
## Mimi Onuoha
### 2015-2018 (Conference 2016)

"The Library of Missing Datasets is a physical repository of those things that have been excluded in a society where so much is collected." In this project, Onuoha gathers the data-sets which are missing, but should exist, in a society which prides itself so heavily on being saturated by data, in order to demonstrate how data isn't the answer to everything, the lack of certain datasets is a demonstration of greater power structures, and gathering those data-sets can also be strategy for resistence. It is important not to interpret the highlighting of missing datasets as a direct call or invocation to fill these gaps. Rather, the topic lends itself to specific and general considerations of our wider system of data collection.
If we begin from the understanding that there will always be data missing from any collection system, we allow ourselves the space to address resulting patterns of inclusion and exclusion.
