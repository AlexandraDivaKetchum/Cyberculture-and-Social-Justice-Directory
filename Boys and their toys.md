# Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman’s Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain.
## Ruth Oldenziel
### 1997

Traces the male-centric dynamic of technology all the way back to the 20's - where the Fisher Body Divison (of General Motors) advertised model car building competitions and other adverts towards young/teen boys exclusively, and included girls in the ads gawking at the male's inventions.  Thus, the narrative that women have to somehow self-conpensate for the failure of not being more represented in tech is challenged, and traced back as far as the 1920's, were technology was already seen as something that men created, and women enjoyed.
