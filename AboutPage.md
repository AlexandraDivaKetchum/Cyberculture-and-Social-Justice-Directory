# About the Cyberculture and Social Justice Directory

The Cyberculture and Social Justice Directory is a public directory of the resources assembled by the Just Feminist Tech and Scholarship Lab. 

Cyberculture is a broad term that speaks to the 

The project focuses on the United States and Canada. 

It was created as part of Alex Ketchum’s project exploring the history of reactions to the creation of computers, the Internet, Big Data, and AI technologies by people with a feminist and social justice lens. As there is imprecision in all of these terms, creating this directory was an attempt to get a sense of larger trends within the findings. It was important to share the findings so others could benefit from the undertaking and build on it as it is useful to them. 

This directory is ever growing, expanding historically and in the future. You can contribute suggestions to the directory here; (link to my email)

## Why Make a Publicly Available Directory of Cyberculture and Social Justice?
Dr. Alex Ketchum of the Just Feminist Tech and Scholarship Lab leads the project. Building on her history of making her research databases and directories publicly available as she did with her dissertation research thefeministrestaurantproject.com and inspired by Mindy Seu’s amazing Cyberfeminism Index (https://cyberfeminismindex.com/about/) . Also related to my forthcoming book Engage in Public Scholarship! You will see some overlap of resources, yet the projects have different motivations. 

This does not mean that the collections have not since acquired new materials or that we did not uncover particular resources. Rather this database is our effort to make available the research that we have conducted for others who may not have the resources to contact hundreds of archives.

The creation of this directory was made possible through the SSHRC Insight Grant # ...

## Design

## Methodology: 

From June 2020 to March 2021, as the topic of feminism and reactions to technology is broad we did a broad search (will link to cleaned up version of ()). We wanted to see what existed in 3 categories of physical archives. 

The research team consisting of _____ and I searched through the finding aids archives and special collections that we divided into 3 categories: Social Movement Archives;  Feminist, Women’s Studies, and LGBTQ+ Archives; and Computer and Tech Archives. We did a broad initial sweep searching the finding aids. The next step involved contacting archivists at those spaces what we found and seeing if we missed anything. The goal of doing this was to try to seek information that might be languishing in the archives. Also archivists always know their collections better than anyone else and the level of detail contained in finding aids varies between different archives due to the resources required to produce them. From here we determined the archives that would be worth the resources to physically visit and also archives whose materials we could either access digitally or seek to digitize. We have also made our findings publicly available. The information that is especially pertinent to the directory is contained within the directory with an indication of where it can be found. 

The list of archives is: (now list by theme in order and where located from the sheet)

The search terms we used were: and we hoped that the holes in what we were searching for could also be helped by the archivists. Archives are always collecting new documents and updating finding aids. If you find information you would like to share, please let us know (here).  Here were the search terms: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyA4iNbWjbfpQW4mqMGc4o3iFMawbBRRPJA--kezAvs/edit?usp=sharing (include them in this) 



How to Navigate/ and Find Sources: 

Within the directory, there will be information where the material can be found. There will also be a series of tags. 



Preservation at the forefront: 

Markdown pages and how accessible. We want you to be able to search this and use this for your research purposes. If this directory is useful for your research purposes, please cite it AND let us know!!! You can also tag us on twitter @cyberdirectoryS


Also using markdown for accessibility: It was then that I stumbled upon John Gruber’s Markdown, and I fell in love immediately. For those who aren’t familiar with it, Markdown is a simple plain text formatting syntax developed in 2004 that is easy to write (well, easier than HTML) and that can be converted to structurally valid HTML. Amusingly, one of the inspirations for Markdown was setext, or structure-enhanced text, another plain text format created by Ian Feldman with input from TidBITS publisher Adam Engst back in 1992 and used since then for TidBITS.
Markdown has changed my life for the better. Not only is it easier to work with than graphical interfaces given the limitations of my vision, but it has caused me to embrace plain text for nearly all of my documents. No longer do I have to work in bloated word processors with toolbars galore, or worry about rich-text formatting. Discovering Markdown has been liberating in the truest sense of the word.

### NHeading 3= Date
write only the year

This is a sample of how we will write the mark down code for the directory.
We will be writing all of the entries in a single markdown file. 


If you want to create a break between the text, hit enter twice. 

TO make a list begin with the dash- then if you want to do a sublist click indent 
This functions similarly to list making in Microsoft Word

- first time
- second time
- third time
  - indented
    1. inner number
    
Here is how we write hyperlinks. You put the description that you want clicked on in the brackets and you then put the url in the parentheses immediately after that 

[this is the description](http://www.github.com)

If you want to create italics, use the * on each side of a word
example * italic *

If youw ant to make the text bold, use the * twice on each side of a word
example ** bold **
