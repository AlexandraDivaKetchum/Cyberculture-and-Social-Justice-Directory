# Cyberfeminism With a Difference
## Rosi Braidotti
### 1996 

This chapter theorizes the postmodern direction which feminists who challenge late-capitalism, and society as technology rises as a means of surveillance, are taking in order to envisage a new and different reality separate from the self-preservationalist goals of late-capitalism.   That being, "minor" genres of fiction such as science fiction but in particular, cyber punk, which demonstrate the ruptures in a seemingly inevitable world and show that a different future may be possible.
