# DIRTY DATA, BAD PREDICTIONS: HOW CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IMPACT POLICE DATA, PREDICTIVE POLICING SYSTEMS, AND JUSTICE 
## Rashida Richardson, Jason M. Schultz and Kate Crawford
### 2019 

The researchers looked at how predictive policing systems, which use prior police collected data to forecast criminal activity and allocate resources, are affected by the "dirty policing" and "dirty data" practices of police forces prior: namely, the skewing of data for crime to appear reduced, extortative methods, planting evidence on innovent people etc. which were known policies of many major police departments in America.  By looking at case studies where predictive policing tools were implemented in Chicago, New Orleans and Maricopa Country, the researchers show that there is insufficient account taken of dirty data affecting and perpetuating biased police practices.  Thus, "the use of predictive policing must be treated with high levels of caution and mechanisms for the public to know, access, and reject such systems"
