# Free is a Lie 
## Aral Balkan
### 2014

In this talk, Aral Balkan unpacks the misconception that "free" internet services such as Facebook and Google platforms come with no cost. He discusses data farming, and how our personal data has become the valuable commodity that comapnies are after in our increasingly surveilled, measured and mapped world.  In 2020, most of this talk is not shocking or new anymore but rather common knowledge.  However, i think that in 2014 this was probably a really fascinating talk.
