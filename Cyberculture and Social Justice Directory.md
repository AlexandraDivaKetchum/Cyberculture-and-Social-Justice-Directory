# Feminism Confronts Technology
## Judy Wajcman
### 1991

Feminism Confronts Technology provides a lively and engaging exploration of the impact of technology on women's lives from word processors to food processors, and genetic engineering to the design of cities. Comprehensive and critical, this book surveys the sociological and feminist literature on technology, highlighting the male bias in the way technology is defined as well as developed. Wajcman sets the scene with an overview of feminist theories of science and technology: encompassing the technologies of production and reproduction as well as domestic technology.

# Cyberfeminism With a Difference
## Rosi Braidotti
### 1996 

This chapter theorizes the postmodern direction which feminists who challenge late-capitalism, and society as technology rises as a means of surveillance, are taking in order to envisage a new and different reality separate from the self-preservationalist goals of late-capitalism.   That being, "minor" genres of fiction such as science fiction but in particular, cyber punk, which demonstrate the ruptures in a seemingly inevitable world and show that a different future may be possible.

# Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman’s Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain.
## Ruth Oldenziel
### 1997

Traces the male-centric dynamic of technology all the way back to the 20's - where the Fisher Body Divison (of General Motors) advertised model car building competitions and other adverts towards young/teen boys exclusively, and included girls in the ads gawking at the male's inventions.  Thus, the narrative that women have to somehow self-conpensate for the failure of not being more represented in tech is challenged, and traced back as far as the 1920's, were technology was already seen as something that men created, and women enjoyed.

# The Disability Divide in Internet Access and Use
## Eszter Hargittai and Kerr Dobransky
### 2006 

This article researches people with disabilities relation to the internet, in terms of how many are using it and how the internet can both be helpful for some and inaccessible for other people with disabilities. A significant finding in the article is that low-income people with disabilities are less likely to have access to a computer and the internet, but those who have stable socioeconomic status do not use it less than able-bodied counterparts.

# Issues in Publishing an Online, Open-Access CALL Journal
## Dorothy M Chun and Irene Thompson
### 2010 

The editors in chief of an open-access, 100% online publication discuss the pros and cons of online journals.  Briefly, the advantages are the broad dissemination, access and efficiency, disadvantages are assumed lesser quality, opinions that these articles are less worthy for tenure and promotion. Digital journals are becoming more popular due to its pros, and its cons can be addressed as universities begin to recognize the importance of web-based open access journals.

# Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-first Century
## Dorothy E. Roberts
### 2011

Looks at how the myth of race being biologically determined rather than socially constructed has been revived by technologies such as edge science, race-specific drugs, genetic testing, and DNA databases.  The myth of the post-racial society is thus challenged directly by Roberts analysis and shown that racism is still pervasive and thriving.

# Digital Inclusion and Data Profiling
##  Seeta Peña Gangadharan
### 2012


"This paper examines specific examples of commercial data profiling against a longer history of low–tech data profiling of chronically underserved communities. It concludes by calling for issues of online privacy and surveillance to punctuate digital inclusion discourse. Until this happens, digital inclusion policies threaten to bring chronically underserved communities into online worlds that, as Gandy (2009) argued, reinforce and exacerbate social exclusion and inequalities." *Summary taken from abstract*

# Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery
## Latanya Sweeney
### 2013

This study examines how automated ads racially profile certain "black-sounding" names online when suggesting arrest records.  Ie. the author discovered when searching up her own name, Latanya Sweeney, ads that read "Latanya Sweeney, arrested?" showed up because of a) other cases of Latanya's being arrested and b) the fact that searching up the name in google images yields mostly black pictures.  Given that names such as Jill did not suggest such ads despite being present in arrest records, the study suggests that algorithms use the info of racially profiled names to suggest ads to look up the arrest histories of black people unfairly.

# Free is a Lie 
## Aral Balkan
### 2014

In this talk, Aral Balkan unpacks the misconception that "free" internet services such as Facebook and Google platforms come with no cost. He discusses data farming, and how our personal data has become the valuable commodity that comapnies are after in our increasingly surveilled, measured and mapped world.  In 2020, most of this talk is not shocking or new anymore but rather common knowledge.  However, i think that in 2014 this was probably a really fascinating talk.

# Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness
## Simone Browne
### 2015 

"Simone Browne locates the conditions of blackness as a key site through which surveillance is practiced, narrated, and resisted. She shows how contemporary surveillance technologies and practices are informed by the long history of racial formation and by the methods of policing black life under slavery, such as branding, runaway slave notices, and lantern laws. Placing surveillance studies into conversation with the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlife, Browne draws from black feminist theory, sociology, and cultural studies to analyze texts as diverse as the methods of surveilling blackness she discusses: from the design of the eighteenth-century slave ship Brooks, Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon, and The Book of Negroes, to contemporary art, literature, biometrics, and post-9/11 airport security practices. Surveillance, Browne asserts, is both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries, borders, and bodies around racial lines, so much so that the surveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social and political norm." *Summary taken from Duke University Press*

# Missing Data Sets and On Missing Datasets
## Mimi Onuoha
### 2015-2018+ (Conference 2016)

"The Library of Missing Datasets is a physical repository of those things that have been excluded in a society where so much is collected." In this project, Onuoha gathers the data-sets which are missing, but should exist, in a society which prides itself so heavily on being saturated by data, in order to demonstrate how data isn't the answer to everything, the lack of certain datasets is a demonstration of greater power structures, and gathering those data-sets can also be strategy for resistence. It is important not to interpret the highlighting of missing datasets as a direct call or invocation to fill these gaps. Rather, the topic lends itself to specific and general considerations of our wider system of data collection.
If we begin from the understanding that there will always be data missing from any collection system, we allow ourselves the space to address resulting patterns of inclusion and exclusion.

# Surveillance and the Public Sphere: confronting a democratic dilemma
## Oscar H Gandy Jr and Professor Louise Amoore
### 2016 

"The increasingly precise segmentation and targeting of commercial messages has been enabled in large part through the analysis of massive amounts of transaction-generated-information. Although some attention has been paid to the use of these privacy invasive strategies within the public sphere, the use of personal data with regard to the formation, implementation and evaluation of public policies at the local, national and regional levels has largely been ignored. After discussing threats of political profiling to the future of public participation in the democratic process, Oscar Gandy will explore some possibilities for managing the nature, extent and distribution of these and associated societal harms." *Summary from video description*

# Black Data 
## Shaka McGlotten
### 2016 

Shaka McGlotten employs the notion of “black data” to explore how black queers trouble the invisible or taken-for-granted operations of states and corporations (mining the data of citizens). ...In particular, (McGlotten) applies a materialist black queer analytic to the “deep web” to grapple with the nsa surveillance scandal, new biometric technologies, and the tech-fueled gentrification of San Francisco. Drawing on case studies from everyday life and artistic practice, McGlotten links the deep web to the ways black bodies, and especially black queer bodies, are understood as data points, as statistical objects or deviations, rather than as ontologically material persons. Ultimately, the essay queries how black queers navigate the perils of data fields in online queer spaces where disclosing one’s racial identity can make one vulnerable to violence. *Chapter in "No Tea, No Shade: New Writings in Black Queer Studies" by Patrick E. Johnson*

# Hail the Maintainers
## Andrew Russell
### 2016

A historically mindful article critiquing the rhetoric of innovation, and upholding the importance of the unglamorous labour of technology maintenance.  For Russel, since post-WW2, "innovation" has become a buzzword that originally stemmed from the replacement of the word progress as a less political, less ethically bound version of technoutopianism.  From there, we see that innovation rhetoric, creating new bigger systems to drastically overhaul the status quo, is pervasive and yet, not realistically bound as the majority of the technologies we use as humans hold up and need to be maintained.  Thus, rather than looking toward the 1% of "innovators," we should centre the large numbers of "maintainers" who ensure that our current infrastructure continue to run.

# How We Became Machine Readable
## Mimi Onuoha

In this talk, Mimi Onuoha discusses how data sets should be intrinsically tied to the data collection process, and how data that claims to represent a whole set of people or things often systematically exclude outliers or variants. Namely, Onuoha discusses the Middletown, Muncie ID case where two researchers collected large swathes of social data to represent the "average american town" and thus america as a whole, while excluding immigrants and african americans in the study.  She also discusses her catcaller experiment, her study wth Fulbright-Nat Geo where she tracked the location data of four groups of participants intimately to tell stories, and the missing datasets project, focusing on the data collection process.

# Elites like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos think they’re being philanthropic. But they could do so much more.
## Eric Johnson
### 2018

Johnson explains how very rich "philanthropists" often dedicate money to and pledge their support for causes that they often are guilty of contributing negatively towards - such as global inequalities and climate change, but will never do anything that harms their bottom line - hence the reason why this philanthropy is a charade of the elites. His new book "the elite charade of changing the world" argues that we've normalized and bought into the idea that the rich and powerful have our best interest in mind, when in fact they are interested in preserving the unequal status quo from which they benefit.

## Ruha Benjamin
### 2019 

"Ruha Benjamin cuts through tech-industry hype to understand how emerging technologies can reinforce white supremacy and deepen social inequity. ... Benjamin argues that automation has the potential to hide, speed, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing neutral and even benevolent when compared to racism of a previous era. Presenting the concept of the New Jim Code, she shows how a range of discriminatory designs encode inequity: by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies, by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions, or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. Moreover, she makes a compelling case for race itself as a kind of tool a technology designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice that is part of the architecture of everyday life."

# Technologies of Control and Our Right of Refusal
## Seeta Peña Gangadharan
### 2019 

"Most of us don’t realise how much digital systems govern access to our basic public services, like education, health and housing. Even more terrifying is how much data is collected about us and used without our knowledge. In 2011, while advocating for broadband adoption policies, Dr Seeta Peña Gangadharan began asking questions about surveillance, privacy, and data profiling. As she reveals a frightening picture of how data profiling works against us, Seeta highlights how people are resisting and why being a good digital citizen means rejecting technological systems that mistreat us." *Summary from video description*

# Decentering Technology in Discourse on Discrimination 
## Seeta Peña Gangadharan and Jedrzej Niklas
### 2019 

Addresses the problem of algorithmic discrimination from a perspective that decentred the tech aspect and instead employs Nancy Fraser's theory of abnormal justice "which highlights interconnections between maldistribution of economic benefits, misrecognition of marginalized communities, and their misrepresentation in political processes." Uses 30 interviews with civil society representatives in Europe's human rights sector to clarify this idea of decentering.

# Dirty Data, Bad Predictions: How Civil Rights Violations Impact Police Data, Predictive Poliving Systems, and Justice
## Rashida Richardson, Jason M. Schultz and Kate Crawford
### 2019 

The researchers looked at how predictive policing systems, which use prior police collected data to forecast criminal activity and allocate resources, are affected by the "dirty policing" and "dirty data" practices of police forces prior: namely, the skewing of data for crime to appear reduced, extortative methods, planting evidence on innovent people etc. which were known policies of many major police departments in America.  By looking at case studies where predictive policing tools were implemented in Chicago, New Orleans and Maricopa Country, the researchers show that there is insufficient account taken of dirty data affecting and perpetuating biased police practices.  Thus, "the use of predictive policing must be treated with high levels of caution and mechanisms for the public to know, access, and reject such systems"

# The Joys of Standards
## Andrew Russell and Lee Vinse
### 2019

The authors discuss the societal benefits of standardization, and examples of where the creation of standards have been a cooperative process, involving many parties, that worked to forge more coorporation and convenience after the standard was used. They wish to push back on the idea that standardization is stifling, Kafka-esque, mediocre and comformist, as well as push back on the idea that "innovation," newness and reinventing prior standards is inherently good, to show that standards are joyful for the creators and consumers of technology alike.

# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power
## Shoshana Zuboff
### 2019 

Zuboff tackles the social, political, business, personal, and technological meaning of "surveillance capitalism" as an unprecedented new market form. It is not simply about tracking us and selling ads, it is the business model for an ominous new marketplace that aims at nothing less than predicting and modifying our everyday behavior-- where we go, what we do, what we say, how we feel, who we're with. She shows that the threat has shifted from a totalitarian "big brother" state to a universal global architecture of automatic sensors and smart capabilities, free from democratic oversight and control.

# Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need 
## Sasha Constanza-Chock
### 2020

This book explores the theory and practice of design justice, demonstrates how universalist design principles and practices erase certain groups of people—specifically, those who are intersectionally disadvantaged or multiply burdened under the matrix of domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism)—and invites readers to “build a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.” Along the way, the book documents a multitude of real-world community-led design practices, each grounded in a particular social movement. Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity in the technology and design professions; it connects design to larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological survival. *Summary taken from MIT Press*

# Queer Times, Black Futures
## Kara Keeling
### 2020

"Queer Times, Black Futures considers the promises and pitfalls of imagination, technology, futurity, and liberation as they have persisted in and through racial capitalism. Kara Keeling explores how the speculative fictions of cinema, music, and literature that center black existence provide scenarios wherein we might imagine alternative worlds, queer and otherwise. In doing so, Keeling offers a sustained meditation on contemporary investments in futurity, speculation, and technology, paying particular attention to their significance to queer and black freedom." *Summary from NYU Press*

# Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies
## Cait McKinney
### 2020

*Information Activism* traces how feminists from the 1970s to the present developed communication networks, databases, and digital archives as the foundation for their activism. These people had to learn collectively how to archive their work and transition from paper to digital-based archival practices, for example. "McKinney demontrates how groups with precarious access to control over information create their own innovative techniques for generating and sharing knowledge."

# When Proof Is Not Enough 
## Mimi Onuoha
### 2020

Article written re: 2020 police protests questionning whether data itself, or in this case video documentation is enough to spark societal empathy and change.  Onuoha uses their background in teaching data-collection to demonstrate that even when historically and experimentally, people are confronted with documentation which contradicts the belief systems of individuals, automatic acceptance of the truth is seldom the result.  Therefore, video of police brutality alone, has its limits in pushing for racial justice.
