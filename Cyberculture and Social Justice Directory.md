# More Work for Mother: the Ironies of Household Technology from the Open Hearth to the Microwave
## Ruth Shwartz Cowan 
### 1985

"In this classic work of women's history (winner of the 1984 Dexter Prize from the Society for the History of Technology), Ruth Schwartz Cowan shows how and why modern women devote as much time to housework as did their colonial sisters. In lively and provocative prose, Cowan explains how the modern conveniences—washing machines, white flour, vacuums, commercial cotton—seemed at first to offer working-class women middle-class standards of comfort. Over time, however, it became clear that these gadgets and gizmos mainly replaced work previously conducted by men, children, and servants. Instead of living lives of leisure, middle-class women found themselves struggling to keep up with ever higher standards of cleanliness." *Quoted from summary*

# The Army and the Microworld: Computers and the Politics of Gender Identity
## Paul N. Edwards
### 1990

This article comments on how despite females rising in their participation in the computer-driven workforce (in the early 90's,) computers and computer related jobs are still seen as a masculine and male-dominated field. These perceptions are accredited to "the modes of thought involved in computer science research, the culture of engineering, and the deeply entangled institutions of military service and of masculinity as a political identity in an age of high technology." *Quoted from article*

# Automating Gender: Postmodern Feminism in the Age of the Intelligent Machine
## Judith/ Jack Halberstam
### 1991

Halberstam evaluates how "the intelligent machines" alter our relationship to gender (Postmodernist Feminism) through the lens of Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto and the Apple logo. "Postmodern feminism ... may benefit from the theory of artificiality.... Such a theory shows that we are already as embedded within the new technologies as they are embodied within us. Both Turing's apple and the female cyborg threaten our ability to differentiate between our natural selves and our machine selves; these images suggest that perhaps already cyborgs are us.

# A Feminist Critique of Artificial Intelligence
## Alison Adam
### 1995

In this article, Adams critiques AI and expert systems using feminist epistemology, specifically subjectivity (that the epistemology of AI stems from rational objectivity and feminism critiques that stance), the distinction between propositional and skills knowledge (knowledge that people wrote down and deemed true vs. the knowledge women learn through doing things that aren't necessarily recorded that AI can't learn) and the role of the body in the making of knowledge (disembodied knowledge/embodied knowledge).  Concludes that AI systems which employ feminist epistemology are few and far between at the present (1995) but have the potential to map out new areas of AI.

#  Designing Intersections—Designing Subjectivity: Feminist Theory and Praxis in a Sex Discrimination Legislation System
## Alison Adam and Chlor Furnival
### 1995

"This paper looks at the intersections between feminist epistemology, feminist jurisprudence and research on artificial intelligence and the law. It is suggested that feminist theory highlights the role of subjectivity which is ignored in the traditional epistemology of AI systems. This allows AI systems to appear to be "perspectiveless" when they may be tacitly used in a normative role which ignores alternative knowledges." Focuses specifically on a case of AI systems trying to provide legal advice for sex discrimination. *Quoted from abstract*

## Lilian Edwards
### 1995

Edwards discusses artifically intellifent "legal expert systems" that ideally are meant to replace lawyers deductive reasoning and replace a human aspect of the field of law.  She explains how a feminist methodology/epistemology can potentially help curb the inherently white, male, elitist bias of legal precedent, and shift to a feminist juriprudence, the replacement of human lawyers with AI is still a technology that should be questioned either way.

"This book takes the process of "reading the body" into the fields at the forefront of culture—the vast spaces mapped by science and technology—to show that the body in high-tech is as gendered as ever. From female body building to virtual reality, from cosmetic surgery to cyberpunk, from reproductive medicine to public health policies to TV science programs, Anne Balsamo articulates the key issues concerning the status of the body for feminist cultural studies in a postmodern world." *Quoted from publisher*

## Rosi Braidotti
### 1996 

This chapter theorizes the postmodern direction which feminists who challenge late-capitalism, and society as technology rises as a means of surveillance, are taking in order to envisage a new and different reality separate from the self-preservationalist goals of late-capitalism.   That being, "minor" genres of fiction such as science fiction but in particular, cyber punk, which demonstrate the ruptures in a seemingly inevitable world and show that a different future may be possible.

# Bias in Computer Systems
## Batya Friedman and Hellen Nissenbaum
### 1996

This article reviews what kinds of bias computer systems may have - including preexisting, technical and emergent bias - and comprehensively reviews the phenomenon of bias to offer a framework for remedying it. The authors suggest that freedom from bias should be counter among other criteria including reliability, accuracy and efficiency according to which the quality of systems in use in society should be judged.

# Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman’s Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain.
## Ruth Oldenziel
### 1997

Traces the male-centric dynamic of technology all the way back to the 20's - where the Fisher Body Divison (of General Motors) advertised model car building competitions and other adverts towards young/teen boys exclusively, and included girls in the ads gawking at the male's inventions.  Thus, the narrative that women have to somehow self-conpensate for the failure of not being more represented in tech is challenged, and traced back as far as the 1920's, were technology was already seen as something that men created, and women enjoyed.

# Zeros + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture
## Sadie Plant
### 1997

"A highly contentious, very readable and totally up-to-the-minute investigation of women’s natural relationship with modern technology, an association which, Plant argues, will trigger a new sexual revolution.

Zeros and Ones is an intelligent, provocative and accessible investigation of the intersection between women, feminism, machines and in particular, information technology. Arguing that the computer is rewriting the old conceptions of man and his world, it suggests that the telecoms revolution is also a sexual revolution which undermines the fundamental assumptions crucial to patriarchal culture. Historical, contemporary and future developments in telecommunications and in IT are interwoven with the past, present and future of feminism, women and sexual difference, and a wealth of connections, parallels and affinities between machines and women are uncovered as a result. Challenging the belief that man was ever in control of either his own agency, the planet, or his machines, this book argues it is seriously undermined by the new scientific paradigms emergent from theories of chaos, complexity and connectionism, all of which suggest that the old distinctions between man, woman, nature and technology need to be radically reassessed." *Quoted from publisher*

# Artificial Knowing : Gender and the Thinking Machine
## Alison Adam 
### 1998

"Artificial Knowing challenges the masculine slant in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) view of the world. Alison Adam admirably fills the large gap in science and technology studies by showing us that gender bias is inscribed in AI-based computer systems. Her treatment of feminist epistemology, focusing on the ideas of the knowing subject, the nature of knowledge, rationality and language, are bound to make a significant and powerful contribution to AI studies." Draws from feminist epistemology, Donna Haraway and Sherry Turkle specifically, to critique AI during the period when technology seemed like a great new horizon. *Quotation taken from publisher summary*

The author conducted research on online forums which shows that while many people believe in continuity between their real life and online racial, gender and class identities, some people distanced themselves from their offline interpretations of these identities.  The thesis of the article is that online identities are performances that need be examined as separate from offline identities.

Burkhalter examines how race, previously seen as a phenotypical physical trait, has carried on into the cybersphere although not based on appearance, but based on perspective, self-identification and voice. He looks into so-called "soc.culture" groups in which self-identified racial bodies continue conversations surrounding their race sans body, and the undisputableness of race is carried on into the internet.

## Phoebe Sengers
### 1999

There has been a history of cultural scholars/critics interested in artifical intelligence's effect on society, as well as a history of artificial intelligence scientists stressing the important of cultural impact and criticism.  However, these ideas remain limited in the field at large, and should be employed more liberally.

# Shaping the Web: Why the Politics of Search Engines Matters
## Lucas D. Itrona and Helen Nissenbaum
### 2000

"This article argues that search engines raise not merely technical issues but also political ones. Our study of search engines suggests that they systematically exclude (in some cases by design and in some accidentally) certain sites, and certain types of sites, in favor of others, systematically give prominence to some at the expense of others.  We argue that such biases, which would lead to a narrowing of the Web’s functioning in society, run counter to the basic architecture of the Web as well as the values and ideals that have fueled widespread support for its growth and development. We consider ways of addressing the politics of search engines, raising doubts whether, in particular, the market mechanism could serve as an acceptable corrective."

This piece explains the history of how an image of Lena Sjööblom, a model who was on the centrefold of Playboy Magazine in 1973, became an icon and baseline image for photocopying technologies for over three decades (without her, or playboys permission).  The researchers developping what would become jpeg and mpeg formats at USC used her image surreptitiously in the lab and it was thusly printed in tech magazines, displayed as demonstration of the technology, etc.  Demonstrates how copyright infringement and pornography, as well as the gendered dynamics of tech, have long been a part of the industry and development of imaging technology.

# Cybertypes: Race, Ethnicity, and Identity on the Internet
## Lisa Nakamura
### 2002

Critical examination of the period proceeding the "Internet Age" (1994-2001), when the invention of the internet sparked ideations about post-national, post-racial equal space of the internet, when that sort of fascination was essentially shattered.  Since then, there is an idea that if you aren't on board with the internet, you are being left behind.. while in fact those being left behind are implicitly people of colour.  Looks at how the internet has posed new racial problems, in the tech industry (such as supposed "diversity" with East Asians but exclusion of Black people) and in online spaces. Written in 2002, so this is somewhat of a historical academic text about the internet.

Using comprehensive U.S. data covering all forms of access technology (chiefly DSL and cable modem), I look for evidence of unequal broadband availability in areas with high concentrations of poor, minority, or rural households. There is little evidence of unequal availability based on income or on black or Hispanic concentration. There is mixed evidence concerning availability based on Native American or Asian concentration. Other findings: Rural location decreases availability; market size, education, Spanish language use, commuting distance, and Bell presence increase availability" *Quoted from abstract*

"Based on insights gleaned from a two-month Internet debate about African American hair and identity politics, this chapter illustrates how gender and race come into play in black women's political claims about hair. [...] In Internet discussions, the participants' references to hairstyle and texture became an explicit means of constructing racial identity and authenticity (ie. natural or not, straightened or not, hair care regimen). The question “BTW [By the way], how do you wear your hair?” was an indirect way of assessing a speaker's ethnic identity and presumed racial consciousness vis-a-vis their hairstyle choices." *Quoted from abstract*

# Women in Computing: The Role of Geek Culture
## Roli Varma 
### 2007

"Geek culture," the high-tech, male centric subculture associated with computer science and engineering has been typified as a stigma preventing women from wanting to enter the field, according to research done at a majority white school.  Here, Varma, interviewed people from various minorities at other American schools to gauge how women of colour felt about the geek stereotype.  Overwhelmingly, WOC didn't mind the geek stereotype if it came with the job security of computer science, and replaced worse stereotypes they faced.  Thus, an intersectional study into the feelings of women about geek culture deepends the discourse.

While designers claim that animated/personified interfaces are more intuitive and natural than the traditional point-and-click interfaces that users encounter, this paper aims to show how virtual humans can enact familiar scripts about women's work, circumscribe the range of possible roles and personalities for women, invoke service to others as the primary context for women's work, and objectify women through a not-so-subtle process of linking technology-as-tool to the idea that women are tools, fetishized instruments to be used in the service of accomplishing users' goals" *Quoted from abstract*

# Health at High Speed: Broadband Internet Access, Health Communication, and the Digital Divide
## Stephen A. Rains
### 2008

"The study reported here explored the broadband digital divide in the context of Internet-based health communication [...] Results showed that those who were younger, more educated, and lived in an urban area were more likely to have a broadband Internet connection in their home. Furthermore, consistent with the CMIS, those with a broadband connection were more likely to use the Internet for health-related information seeking and communication than those with a dial-up connection." *Quoted from abstract*

# Issues in Publishing an Online, Open-Access CALL Journal
## Dorothy M Chun and Irene Thompson
### 2010 

The editors in chief of an open-access, 100% online publication discuss the pros and cons of online journals.  Briefly, the advantages are the broad dissemination, access and efficiency, disadvantages are assumed lesser quality, opinions that these articles are less worthy for tenure and promotion. Digital journals are becoming more popular due to its pros, and its cons can be addressed as universities begin to recognize the importance of web-based open access journals.

# Feminist Technology
## Linda L. Layne, Sharra L. Vostral, and Kate Boyer
### 2010

In this collection, feminist scholars consider the question of what makes a technology feminist by examining a range of products, tools, and technologies specifically designed for and marketed to women. "Evaluating the claims that such products are liberating for women, the contributors focus on case studies of menstrual-suppressing birth control pills, home pregnancy tests, tampons, breast pumps, Norplant, anti-fertility vaccines, and microbicides. In examining these various products, this volume explores ways of actively intervening to develop better tools for designing, promoting, and evaluating feminist technologies." *Quoted from publisher*

# Why So Few Women Enroll in Computing? Gender and Ethnic Differences in Students’ Perception
## Roli Varma
### 2010

"This article examines the reasons behind low enrollment of women in CS/CE education at institutions of higher education. It is based on 150 in-depth interviews of female and male undergraduate students majoring in CS/CE, members of five major ethnic groups from seven Minority-Serving Institutions in the USA. The article finds bias in early socialization and anxiety toward technology as two main factors responsible for the under-representation of women in CS/CE education. It further shows significant gender and ethnic differences in students' responses on why so few women enroll in CS/CE." *Quoted from abstract*

# Affect & Artificial Intelligence
## Elizabeth A. Wilson
### 2010

Wilson shows "that early researchers were more engaged with questions of emotion than many commentators have assumed. She documents how affectivity was managed in the canonical works of Walter Pitts in the 1940s and of Turing in the 1950s," all the way into the 90's." "In this fresh and provocative contribution to affect studies, Elizabeth Wilson convincingly argues that from its beginnings the theory and practice of artificial intelligence has been decisively marked by feelings---surprise, curiosity, delight, shame, and contempt---as well as computational logic."

# A Need for Speed? Rural Internet Connectivity and the No Access/ Dial-Up/High-Speed Decision
## Brian E. Whitacre and Bradford F. Mills
### 2010

This article uses a nested logit model to explore the household decision between no Internet access, dial-up access and high-speed access. A decomposition technique is then used to estimate the contributions of various factors, including education, income and infrastructure levels, to differences in Internet access among rural and urban households. The results suggest that policies which solely promote infrastructure in rural areas fail to address the dominant factors in the emerging high-speed digital divide.

Refutes the idea that technology will magically, economically and socially improve our world, since this idea is rooted in the neglect of poor and working class women and families, who technology is inclined to simultaneously help and oppress. "Eubanks describes a new approach to creating a broadly inclusive and empowering “technology for people,” *popular technology*, which entails shifting the focus from teaching technical skill to nurturing critical technological citizenship, building resources for learning, and fostering social movement." *Quote from book summary*

# Intersecting Oppressions and Online Communities: Examining the experiences of women of color in Xbox Live
## Kishonna L. Gray
### 2011

This paper is on the oppressions experienced by WOC in the online gaming community Xbox Live and employs qualitative methods, ethnography, and an intersectional framework.  Since the game can involve speaking in an online room with other players on your team, Latina and African-American women are linguistically profiled for their gender and sometimes sexuality by the way they sound, especially in the context where people hide behind their screens and have little to no consequences for what they say.  This has led to women segregating from these larger communities and creating their own spaces.

# Reducing Barriers to Online Access for People with Disabilities
## Paul Jaegar and Jonathan Lazar
### 2011

The article focuses on the online access of Internet for people with disabilities in the U.S. It states that most Internet-related technologies are inaccessible to disabled people because of the Internet access policy which is considered to reject the needs of disabled people. It adds that solving limited compatibility of Web content is the challenge facing online access for visually impaired people, while the lack of interactive Web chats is the problem associated with hearing impaired people.

# Revisiting Cyberfeminism
## Susanna Paasonen
### 2011

This academic article examines the concept of *Cyberfeminism*, from a historical perspective.  Paaronen explains how the term "cyberspace" was momentarily popular in the 1990's and is no longer popular now.  Thus, cyberfeminism was a historical moment where the possibilities of the internet in its nascent form attracted feminists and others as a realm of possibility, where cyberspace was disembodied from our realities, an idea which has not lasted since today, our online personnas are connected to our real lives.  Thus, the future of feminism on the internet may be inspired by this history but will look different depending on how feminists interact with cyberculture.

Ideas that Myspace was becoming a place that was "more ghetto" or "for those who like hip hop/rap," teens drew racial boundaries and showed that the shift to Facebook was based in racial undertones of feeling like black culture and people were overpopulating MySpace and thus "fleeing" for Facebook.

# Digital Inclusion and Data Profiling
##  Seeta Peña Gangadharan

"This paper examines specific examples of commercial data profiling against a longer history of low–tech data profiling of chronically underserved communities. It concludes by calling for issues of online privacy and surveillance to punctuate digital inclusion discourse. Until this happens, digital inclusion policies threaten to bring chronically underserved communities into online worlds that, as Gandy (2009) argued, reinforce and exacerbate social exclusion and inequalities." *Summary taken from abstract*

# Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle for Internet Freedom 
## Rebecca MacKinnon
### 2013

"In Consent of the Networked, journalist and Internet policy specialist Rebecca MacKinnon argues that it is time to fight for our rights before they are sold, legislated, programmed, and engineered away. Every day, the corporate sovereigns of cyberspace (Google and Facebook, among others) make decisions that affect our physical freedom -- but without our consent. Yet the traditional solution to unaccountable corporate behavior -- government regulation -- cannot stop the abuse of digital power on its own, and sometimes even contributes to it.

A clarion call to action, Consent of the Networked shows that it is time to stop arguing over whether the Internet empowers people, and address the urgent question of how technology should be governed to support the rights and liberties of users around the world." *Summary quoted from Amazon*

# Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery
## Latanya Sweeney
### 2013

This study examines how automated ads racially profile certain "black-sounding" names online when suggesting arrest records.  Ie. the author discovered when searching up her own name, Latanya Sweeney, ads that read "Latanya Sweeney, arrested?" showed up because of a) other cases of Latanya's being arrested and b) the fact that searching up the name in google images yields mostly black pictures.  Given that names such as Jill did not suggest such ads despite being present in arrest records, the study suggests that algorithms use the info of racially profiled names to suggest ads to look up the arrest histories of black people unfairly.

# Why Women Aren't Welcome on the Internet
## Amanda Hess
### 2014, updated 2017

This article about the author (a female journalist who "writes about sex") describes her experience being targeted with death threats, rape threats, doxxing and more. Hess explores how this is the standard experience for women who voice their opinions on the internet. Female-presenting usernames and accounts are disproportionately cyberbullied and targeted with sexually explicit and threatening messages compared to men. Hess also discusses the issue regarding jurisdiction for legal action regarding these threats, highlighting how law enforcement belittles these threats and redirects victims to Twitter, while Twitter redirects back to law enforcement.

# Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture
## Lisa Nakamura 
### 2014

Traces the history of Navajo women who were employed at a tech manufacturing plant from 1965-75. "In the face of concerns about high-tech pollution, increasingly empowered labor organizations, and a newly politicized and visible American Indian civil rights movement, indigenous electronic workers at Shiprock were pressed into service as examples of the peaceful coexistence and integration of the past and the future, the primitive and the modern, creativity and capitalism. Navajo women workers were described as ideal predigital digital workers, uniquely suited to the job by temperament, culture, and gender. Their labor as platform builders was cited as evidence that digital work—the work of the hand and its digits—could be painlessly transferred from the indigenous cultural context into the world of technological commercial innovation, benefiting both in the process" *Quoted from article abstract*

# Cyber-Violence Against Women
## Jessica West 
### 2014

Literature review and research report on how women experience violence in cyberspace, how this sort of violence compares to physical abuse/sexual assault, and how it differs. Notably, anonymity, cyberstalking and appropriating womens images and writings are common forms. The vastness of the internet gives perpetrators a feeling of invincibility, yet also the internet's permanence makes cyber-violence different from offline forms.  How this violence impacts women's lives, how to resists and what the community can do etc. is discussed: more support from online platforms to address cyberviolence, tighter terms of use, legal reform so that women may take action, increasing awarenes, education and awareness campaigns, focusing on protecting young girls. The "get off the internet" approach is not sufficient to protect women from cyber-violence.

# Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness
## Simone Browne
### 2015 

"Simone Browne locates the conditions of blackness as a key site through which surveillance is practiced, narrated, and resisted. She shows how contemporary surveillance technologies and practices are informed by the long history of racial formation and by the methods of policing black life under slavery, such as branding, runaway slave notices, and lantern laws. Placing surveillance studies into conversation with the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlife, Browne draws from black feminist theory, sociology, and cultural studies to analyze texts as diverse as the methods of surveilling blackness she discusses: from the design of the eighteenth-century slave ship Brooks, Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon, and The Book of Negroes, to contemporary art, literature, biometrics, and post-9/11 airport security practices. Surveillance, Browne asserts, is both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries, borders, and bodies around racial lines, so much so that the surveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social and political norm." *Summary taken from Duke University Press*

In this project, Onuoha gathers the data-sets which are missing, but should exist, in a society which prides itself so heavily on being saturated by data, in order to demonstrate how data isn't the answer to everything, the lack of certain datasets is a demonstration of greater power structures, and gathering those data-sets can also be strategy for resistence. It is important not to interpret the highlighting of missing datasets as a direct call or invocation to fill these gaps. Rather, the topic lends itself to specific and general considerations of our wider system of data collection.
If we begin from the understanding that there will always be data missing from any collection system, we allow ourselves the space to address resulting patterns of inclusion and exclusion.

# Making Computers Accessible : Disability Rights and Digital Technology
## Elizabeth R. Petrick
### 2015

"Petrick tells the compelling story of how computer engineers and corporations gradually became aware of the need to make computers accessible for all people. Motivated by user feedback and prompted by legislation [...], companies developed sophisticated computerized devices and software to bridge the accessibility gap. People with disabilities, Petrick argues, are paradigmatic computer users, demonstrating the personal computer’s potential to augment human abilities and provide for new forms of social, professional, and political participation." *Quoted from summary*

# Innovating Inequity: If Race is a Technology, Postracialism is the Genius Bar
## Ruha Benjamin
### 2016 

The author suggests that technology has created the new postracial in which racism is obscured by constant reinvention, the "universality" of technology, and that technology has innovated racism into its fabric while being "postracial"

# Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings
## Tolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Y Zou, Venkatesh Saligrama, and Adam T Kalai
### 2016 

 This article shows how "word embeddings" a popular machine learning framework, exhibits female/male gender stereotypes and amplifies these biases, ie, associating the words receptionist and female.  The authors then offer their own methodology to remove these negative stereotypes by modifying the word embedding process and therefore not amplifying gender bias

# Black + Twitter: A Cultural Informatics Approach
## Andre Brock Jr.
### 2016 

"Chris Sacca, activist investor, recently argued that Twitter IS Black Twitter. African American usage of the service often dominates user metrics in the United States, despite their minority demographic status among computer users. This talk unpacks Black Twitter use from two perspectives: analysis of the interface and associated practice alongside discourse analysis of Twitter’s utility and audience. Using examples of Black Twitter practice, I offer that Twitter’s feature set and ubiquity map closely onto Black discursive identity. Thus, Twitter’s outsized function as mechanism for cultural critique and political activism can be understood as the awakening of Black digital practice and an abridging of a digital divide."

# Sci-Hub: A Solution to the Problem of Paywalls, or Merely a Diagnosis of a Broken System?
## Jeremy S. Faust
### 2016

This article looks at Sci-Hub, a website for pirated peer-review science and medicine research, and how its popularity is not necessarily due to the paywalls which prevent its users from accessing information, but the reliability and accessibility which it provides by having all these articles in one place without such a large "click burden" and "request access" barriers within researchers' own institutions.

# Surveillance and the Public Sphere: confronting a democratic dilemma
## Oscar H Gandy Jr and Professor Louise Amoore
### 2016 

"The increasingly precise segmentation and targeting of commercial messages has been enabled in large part through the analysis of massive amounts of transaction-generated-information. Although some attention has been paid to the use of these privacy invasive strategies within the public sphere, the use of personal data with regard to the formation, implementation and evaluation of public policies at the local, national and regional levels has largely been ignored. After discussing threats of political profiling to the future of public participation in the democratic process, Oscar Gandy will explore some possibilities for managing the nature, extent and distribution of these and associated societal harms." *Summary from video description*

# The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Feminist Antiracism and Feminist Accountability
## Kristen Hogan
### 2016

"From the 1970s through the 1990s more than one hundred feminist bookstores built a transnational network that helped shape some of feminism's most complex conversations. Kristen Hogan traces the feminist bookstore movement's rise and eventual fall, restoring its radical work to public feminist memory. The bookwomen at the heart of this story—mostly lesbians and including women of color—measured their success not by profit, but by developing theories and practices of lesbian antiracism and feminist accountability. [...] In retelling their stories, Hogan not only shares the movement's tools with contemporary queer antiracist feminist activists and theorists, she gives us a vocabulary, strategy, and legacy for thinking through today's feminisms." *Quoted from publisher*

# Feminism, Labour and Digital Media: The Digital Housewife 
## Kylie Jarrett
### 2016

"There is a contradiction at the heart of digital media. We use commercial platforms to express our identity, to build community and to engage politically. At the same time, our status updates, tweets, videos, photographs and music files are free content for these sites. We are also generating an almost endless supply of user data that can be mined, re-purposed and sold to advertisers. As users of the commercial web, we are socially and creatively engaged, but also labourers, exploited by the companies that provide our communication platforms. How do we reconcile these contradictions?

Feminism, Labour and Digital Media argues for using the work of Marxist feminist theorists about the role of domestic work in capitalism to explore these competing dynamics of consumer labour. It uses the concept of the Digital Housewife to outline the relationship between the work we do online and the unpaid sphere of social reproduction." *Summary taken from publisher site*

# Black Data 
## Shaka McGlotten
### 2016 

Shaka McGlotten employs the notion of “black data” to explore how black queers trouble the invisible or taken-for-granted operations of states and corporations (mining the data of citizens). ...In particular, (McGlotten) applies a materialist black queer analytic to the “deep web” to grapple with the nsa surveillance scandal, new biometric technologies, and the tech-fueled gentrification of San Francisco. Drawing on case studies from everyday life and artistic practice, McGlotten links the deep web to the ways black bodies, and especially black queer bodies, are understood as data points, as statistical objects or deviations, rather than as ontologically material persons. Ultimately, the essay queries how black queers navigate the perils of data fields in online queer spaces where disclosing one’s racial identity can make one vulnerable to violence. *Chapter in "No Tea, No Shade: New Writings in Black Queer Studies" by Patrick E. Johnson*

# Rise of the Machines : A Cybernetic History
## Thomas Rid
### 2016

Historicizing cybernetics from its birth to current day, Rid shows how Cybernetics (the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things) born in the Post-War era, was never a Post-War science, but rather was focused on how to enforce Cold War theatres of dominance and war. Thus, despite the utopianist imagination born out of cybernetics (ie. cyborg manifesto), the history of the science reveals how from the start to the present, it was focused on national security, surveillance and American militarism.

# Hail the Maintainers
## Andrew Russell
### 2016

A historically mindful article critiquing the rhetoric of innovation, and upholding the importance of the unglamorous labour of technology maintenance.  For Russel, since post-WW2, "innovation" has become a buzzword that originally stemmed from the replacement of the word progress as a less political, less ethically bound version of technoutopianism.  From there, we see that innovation rhetoric, creating new bigger systems to drastically overhaul the status quo, is pervasive and yet, not realistically bound as the majority of the technologies we use as humans hold up and need to be maintained.  Thus, rather than looking toward the 1% of "innovators," we should centre the large numbers of "maintainers" who ensure that our current infrastructure continue to run.

# Gender Shades: Intersectional Phenotypic and Demographic Evaluation of Face Datasets and Gender Classifiers 
## Joy Buolamwini
### 2017

Masters thesis analyzing datasets that look into AI based facial recognition technologies which profile/identify people in the contexts of hiring, police confrontations, self driving cars and surveillance etc.  Concludes that the datasets that these facial recognition technologies are learning from are overwhelmingly light-skinned, and often also overwhelmingly male.  This greatly effects these technologies' accuracy and margin of error in identifying darkskinned women and men, which could have many negative effects.

# Network Sovereignty: Building the Internet across Indian Country
## Marisa Elena Duarte
### 2017

"In 2012, the [UN] General Assembly determined that affordable Internet access is a human right, critical to citizen participation in democratic governments. Given the significance of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to social and political life, many U.S. tribes and Native organizations have created their own projects, from streaming radio to building networks to telecommunications advocacy. [This book] examines these ICT projects to explore the significance of information flows and information systems to Native sovereignty, and toward self-governance, self-determination, and decolonization. By reframing how tribes and Native organizations harness these technologies as a means to overcome colonial disconnections, Network Sovereignty shifts the discussion of information and communication technologies in Native communities from one of exploitation to one of Indigenous possibility." *Summary quoted from publisher*

# How #Blacklivesmatter: exploring the role of hip-hop celebrities in constructing racial identity on Black Twitter
## Summer Harlow and Anna Benbrook
### 2017

The authors of this article qualitatively and quantitatively studied #BlackLivesMatter on Twitter in terms of Black hip-hop celebrities and how these people constructed black identity around the BLM movement, since Black Twitter, and hip-hop's influence in American culture/counterculture is so immense.  They concluded that despite the hashtag being closely associated with the protests in Ferguson and activism at large, Black hip-hop celebrities were a) less inclined to tweet with the hashtag than white celebs and b) fell into four distinct themes: speaking to whites, solidarity, Black is beautiful, and equality, which shows how they desire to construct black identity.

# Programmed Inequality : How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing
## Mar Hicks
### 2017

*Programmed Inequality* is about the history of computing. It discusses how from World War II to the 1960's, Britain was at the cutting edge of computer technology but lost that edge, in large part due to the way that the largely female, technologically oriented workforce was structurally replaced by men because of discrimination and the assumption that computer science should be male-dominated naturally.  These decisions caused "the civil service and sprawling public sector'to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole."  A lesson in how even women who possess the skills of computing will not naturally fit into the industry, and how the US risks repeating those risks in the 21st century.

# Resource Scarcity and Socially Just Internet Access over Time and Space
## Daniel Pargman and Bjorn Wallsten
### 2017

"the infrastructure for computing is dependent on limited non-renewable material resources and ... the costs for extraction can be expected to rise during the coming decades due to limits on mining the Earth’s crust. The current path of innovating and deploying progressively more advanced systems for computing is hardly sustainable in the medium to long run. Bearing this in mind, it would be prudent to husband resources and to shift from an emphasis on innovation to a focus on maintenance. The goal should be to reject “the cornucopian paradigm” [44] and aim for developing a suitable infrastructure and a “sufficient” level of service so as to guarantee the largest functionality for the lowest cost and the greatest number of people for the longest possible duration both within and between countries. This is what we mean when we refer to socially just internet access over time (extending the benefits of digital technologies as far as possible into the future) and space (extending the benefits of digital technologies to the largest number of people possible). To that end, it seems prudent to restrict innovations that use up scarce resources, and especially so if they deliver only marginal improvements that benefit only the few. We have refrained from suggesting exactly how this could be done, but any concrete policy suggestion for how to alter incentives for innovation is bound to be provocative-bordering-on-incendiary.

# Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest
## Zeynep Tufekci
### 2017

"Could the ability to organize massive protests quickly on Facebook and Twitter be making those protests vulnerable in the long term? If new technologies are so empowering, why are so many movements failing to curb authoritarianism’s rise? Is a glut of misinformation more effective censorship than directly forbidding speech? Why are so many of today’s movements leaderless? Zeynep Tufekci answers these questions and more," explaining the role the internet played in movmeents such as the Zapatista uprisings, the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement and in Gezi Park (Turkey.) "She also looks at how governments have responded to the rise of digital tools with their own methods, including misinformation, distraction, and surveillance." Offers essential and surprising insights into the public sphere and future of governance in the 21st century.

# How We Became Machine Readable
## Mimi Onuoha
### 2017 

In this talk, Mimi Onuoha discusses how data sets should be intrinsically tied to the data collection process, and how data that claims to represent a whole set of people or things often systematically exclude outliers or variants. Namely, Onuoha discusses the Middletown, Muncie ID case where two researchers collected large swathes of social data to represent the "average american town" and thus america as a whole, while excluding immigrants and african americans in the study.  She also discusses her catcaller experiment, her study wth Fulbright-Nat Geo where she tracked the location data of four groups of participants intimately to tell stories, and the missing datasets project, focusing on the data collection process.

### 2018

This article traces the connections of the engineering profession historically and presently with authoritarianism, fascism and fundamentalism.  They're desire for a well ordered world, centralized power to create big state structures, and the lack of ethics regulation leaving much up to corporate interest, are all problematic to Banks, and they suggest cultivating the engineering mindset of building things as a form of care, considering other liberal arts and philosophies, and interogating the power structures that engingeering is implicated in.

# Design Justice, AI, and Escape from the Matrix of Domination

Through the author's personal experience interacting with A.I. technologies as a trans non-binary femme presenting person, this article argues that people's experience with AI systems differ, and they should be redesigned.  However, even though A.I. development is primarily driven by capitalist profitability, and that there is a growing community of technologists, computer scientists etc. who are taking these issues into account.

# What the Internet is for 
## Cory Doctorow
### 2018

Doctorow insists that while the internet is built on revolutionary technologies such as end-to-end communications and universal computers, it is not in itself revolutionary.  In fact, the internet has aided and abetted authoritarian regimes and suppressed revolutionaries in some cases.  However, he argues that although the internet is not inherently revolutionary, it has the potential to be used for revolutionary purposes, such as coordinating mass movements against authority.  Thus, it is not enough to say the internet itself is revolutionary technology.

# I get by with a little help from my friends: The Ecological Model and Support for Women Scholars Experiencing Online Harassment
## Chandell Gosse, Jaigris Hodson, Shandell Houlden, George Veletsianos
### 2018

This article aims to understand the phenomenon behind online abuse and harassment towards women scholar. Data was collected from 14 interviews to determine and report on the types of supports these women sought during and after their experiences. There are three levels of support: personal and social; organizational, technological, and sectoral; larger cultural and social attitudes and discourses. Participants relied on social and peronal support most frequently, but they often relied on multiple supports across all three levels. The authors used an ecological model to demonstrate how different types of support are interconnected.

# Becoming NULL: Queer Relations in the Excluded Middle

### 2018

Article discusses Facebook's move to include 56 gender identities (from 2) as not queer acceptence, but as a part of a society of control and identification which strives to know more about people using Facebook plainly, to collect that data for advertisements.  Demonstrably, trans people and drag performers were removed from Facebook and flagged, told that they had to provide legal documentation of their name to keep those profiles.  Thus, facebook really doesn't care about respecting gender identities and inclusivity.

# Elites like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos think they’re being philanthropic. But they could do so much more.
## Eric Johnson
### 2018

Johnson explains how very rich "philanthropists" often dedicate money to and pledge their support for causes that they often are guilty of contributing negatively towards - such as global inequalities and climate change, but will never do anything that harms their bottom line - hence the reason why this philanthropy is a charade of the elites. His new book "the elite charade of changing the world" argues that we've normalized and bought into the idea that the rich and powerful have our best interest in mind, when in fact they are interested in preserving the unequal status quo from which they benefit.

# Gender Bias in Artificial Intelligence: The Need for Diversity and Gender Theory in Machine Learning
## Susan Leavy
### 2018

Analyzes how gender-biases can become embedded in AI through machine learning if datasets are embedded with the same gender-bias which the data that it is fed may contain. For example, the naming of humans as "mankind" or the idea of the "family man" with no female equivalent, the ordering of "man" before "wife", "boy" before "girl", or the sheer lack of women present in certain literature to name a few.  Since AI developpers are overwhelmingly male, and those who call-out and see gender-bias in machine learning are women themselves, women ought be called in to intervene and point out these potentialities.

# Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism

Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, especially women of color."

# Diversity is a Dangerous Set-up
## Chanda Prescod-Weinstein
### 2018

"Trying to use science to analyze and fix racism is a dangerous proposition. The science behind implicit bias may be bunk. Promoting diversity rather than substantive structural change will not create equal opportunity and equal outcomes. A focus on implicit bias at the expense of an attention to both explicit bias and the impact of bias may in fact be harmful to the fight for equality. And Black people — from folks on the street to the first Black Supreme Court Justice — have been trying to tell y’all this." *Quoted from abstract*

# On the Wrong Side of the Digital Divide in Cleveland, OH
## Afi Scruggs
### 2018

This article discusses the digital redlining/division between internet service provision within Cleveland, OH, through the profile of David Rosario, an individual who relies solely on his smartphone and its data to apply for jobs, use the internet in any way, because he can't afford the added cost of an internet bill. In a broader way, the article discsuses how predominantly black, inner city neighbourhoods are less likely to have sufficient broadband internet access and this is in part the fault of service comapnies such as AT&T which have deliberately kept the internet infrastructure in these areas obsolete, which in turn disqualifies the residents from affordable broadband internet access programs. In general, the article emphasizes that stable home internet, suitable for video streaming and telehealth for example, are vitally important in this day and age and should be advocated for.

# The Automation Charade
## Astra Taylor
### 2018

Debunks the myth that AI will soon displace many workers from their jobs and human labour will become obsolete. In fact, human jobs are not going anywhere, these jobs just look different, are taken up by different people, particularly those in the "global south."  For example, our assumption that automatic algorithms filter what we see online occludes the thousands of workers in the global south who parse through traumatizing images to deem them innapropriate. A historical example is how Thomas Jefferson avidly used dumbwaiters, which made it seem like food magically appeared, to occlude how he was exploiting slaves who were still the ones preparing the food. The myth of "fauxtomation" is in fact a capitalist invention to forever make workers feel replaceable and vulnerable

# Asking More of Siri and Alexa: Feminine Persona in Service of Surveillance Capitalism
## Heather Suzanne Woods
### 2018

"This paper illuminates how gendered stereotypes can be leveraged to assuage anxieties surrounding artificially intelligent virtual assistants (AI VA). In particular, the analysis shows that these AI objects routinely traffic in normative gender roles of the feminine as caretaker, mother, and wife in order to obfuscate modes of surveillance, and mediate the relationship users and potential users have with late-capitalist market logics in the platform economy. Mobilizing essentialist feminine personas characterized in this paper as “digital domesticity,” artificially intelligent objects orient users to engage productively with surveillance capitalism as natural." Concentrates on Siri and Alexa. *Quoted from abstract*

# Puncturing the Pipeline: Do Technology Companies Alienate Women in Recruiting Sessions?

### 2018

Studies how even after the obstacle of being the few women who make it through computer science education, they face obstacles at the employment level. "Using original observational data from 84 recruiting sessions hosted by technology companies at a prominent university on the US West Coast, we find that company representatives often engage in behaviors that are known to create a chilly environment for women. Through gender-imbalanced presenter roles, geek culture references, overt use of gender stereotypes, and other gendered speech and actions, representatives may puncture the pipeline, lessening the interest of women at the point of recruitment into technology careers." *Quoted from abstract*

# AI Now 2019 Report
## AI Now Institute
### 2019

An annual report describing the concerns and proposals for the AI industry in 2019.  The main points of the executive summary read as follows: 1. The spread of algorithmic management technology in the workplace is increasing the power  asymmetry between workers and employers. AI threatens not only to disproportionately  displace lower-wage earners, but also to reduce wages, job security, and other protections for  those who need it most.  2. Community groups, workers, journalists, and researchers—not corporate AI ethics statements  and policies—have been primarily responsible for pressuring tech companies and  governments to set guardrails on the use of AI. 3. Efforts to regulate AI systems are underway, but they are being outpaced by government  adoption of AI systems to surveil and control. 4. AI systems are continuing to amplify race and gender disparities via techniques like affect  recognition, which has no sound scientific basis.  5. Growing investment in and development of AI has profound implications in areas ranging from  climate change to the rights of healthcare patients to the future of geopolitics and inequities  being reinforced in regions in the global South.

# Discriminating Systems: Gender, Race and Power in AI
## AI Now Institute
### 2019

Research project which looks into the diversity problem of those working in AI industries and the bias and discrimination in AI systems -- two intertwined problems.  The researchers found that the status quo of the AI industry and its attempts to rememdy the "diversity problem" have been insufficient considering how the origins of AI research have always marginalized women, and poc.  Therefore, there must be a commitment to greater diversity, equality, and transparency around workplace cultures, and AI developpers must consider the biases which AI could perpetuate and specific tests and research should be geared towards preventing this.

# Excavating AI: The Politics of Training Sets for Machine Learning 
## AI Now Institute
### 2019

Investigates how in the early era of developping machine learning sets, objects and people alike were taught to categorize images into subsets and identify parts of the photo-- for people however, this proved to be more subjective and problematic.  ImageNet, a specific machine learning image recognition site, had problematic labels in their "persons" category ie. designating people as drunk, slattern, loser arbitrarily... The attempt to detect and measure characteristics of people based on their physical appearance is comporably to phrenology of medical anthropologists and eugenicists - that is, usually liberal scientists trying to apply objective methods to study human beings.  Even though sites and databases like ImageNet have taken down their people sections, these data sets have been copied and influenced AI and facial recognition technologies today.

# Race after technology: abolitionist tools for the new Jim code
## Ruha Benjamin
### 2019 

"Ruha Benjamin cuts through tech-industry hype to understand how emerging technologies can reinforce white supremacy and deepen social inequity. ... Benjamin argues that automation has the potential to hide, speed, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing neutral and even benevolent when compared to racism of a previous era. Presenting the concept of the New Jim Code, she shows how a range of discriminatory designs encode inequity: by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies, by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions, or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. Moreover, she makes a compelling case for race itself as a kind of tool a technology designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice that is part of the architecture of everyday life."

# “Color-Blindness” is a Bad Approach to Solving Bias in Algorithms
## Jessie Daniels
### 2019

Challenges the conventional notion that the colourblindness of AI algorithms is the key to racial justice in tehcnology, by showing show racism continues to manifest in these machines, and that taking race into account in fact increases racial literacy.  By hiring more black people, and taking race into account at large when developping these technologies, it will fix the problem better. "Industry leaders, policy makers, and workers who are born in the US or western Europe need racial literacy to become fluent in the difficult discussions of racial inequality. If they’re not, they will inadvertently adopt the worst aspects of the dominant white culture."

Interview with Joan Greenbaum, an individual who has for 50-60 years, dedicated her life to organizing tech workers/unionizing in an attempt to gain influence over the ethics and the values of these large tech companies, such as opposing the war in Vietnam, discrimination in the computer field and against african americans at large, and mass data. In the interview, she talks about the difficulties in unionizing while working in her collective alled Computer People for Peace (CCP), difficulties which included unreceptive computer programmers to the idea of organizing, the way that occupation names have changed over the decades, her zine Interrupt, and the continual importance of this work.

# Black Software: The Internet & Racial Justice, from the AfroNet to Black Lives Matter
## Charlton D. McIlwain
### 2019

The story of the racial justice movement online spans nearly five decades and involves engingeers, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, journalists and activists, but this history is virtually unknown. McIlwain chronicles the relationship between African Americans, computing technology and the internet and centres those forgotten figures who made todays online racial justice activism possible. Black Software centres AA's role in the internet's creation and evolution "illuminating both the limits and possibilities for using digital technology to push for racial justice in US and across the globe."

# Can the Internet Survive Climate Change?
## Kevin Lozano
### 2019

Article that discusses the tangible, ecological toll of the internet and potential green solutions to the issue of internet, energy, and technolgy which we will face in the coming years.  For example, how high bandwith websites have greater carbon emissions and thus ads which run all over the internet increase the carbon footprint of visiting a website by double. Also, the infrastructure which we rely on for internet, ie. huge warehouses storing data, the pipes and minerals used to transport data, will all become unsustainable in the next few decades. Explores a future internet that is "locally governed, slower, and sustainable."

# For a Greener Future, We Must Accept There’s Nothing Inherently Sustainable About Going Digital
## Jessica McLean
### 2019

As the title states, there is nothing inherently green about going digital, in fact, the internet has a huge carbon footprint; data centres use 2% of the world's electricity and generate the same amount of carbon emissions as the global airline industry, training one AI machine would produce 5 times as much as what one car would emit over a persons lifetime, satellites and wires and continuously being build in nature, and big tech doesn't care.

# A.I. Is Not as Advanced as You Might Think
## Mutale Nakonde
### 2019

A.I. is a field that is no more advanced than the racist society it was build off of. For example, the field is oversaturated by white men with very few black people developping AI with the likes of Google, and the data sets that machine learning takes from are embedded with the racial biases of the humans which created those data sets.

# Look Up and Smile: Seeing through Alexa’s Algorithmic Gaze
## Nassim Parvin
### 2019

This article analyzes Alexa's new feautre "Echo Look," which is touted by Amazon to be a personal stylist, as evidence of how this AI technology is scary and reinforces ideas of the disciplinary gaze, especially on women and their beauty standards.  From the slogan of the camera to capture ones outfit ("look up and smile," extremely catcall-ish) and the way it makes people question their fashion from an automated beauty standard based probably on conventional beauty standards, Echo Look at large is a scary and strange technology.

# A Gendered Perspective on Artificial Intelligence
## Smriti Parsheera
### 2019

Analyzes how the process of knowledge-making in AI can enforce and exacerbate the power structures and biases which have plagued the field of AI from in its inception, from its creators to the gendered-biased society which the AI is learning from.  Proposes strategies for machines to eliminate rather than reinforce human biases such as publically developed standards which embed the concept of "fairness by design," investing in R&D which translates ethical principles into actual practice and reducing gendered distortions in underlying datasets to remove bias in future AI projects.

# Technologies of Control and Our Right of Refusal
## Seeta Peña Gangadharan
### 2019 

"Most of us don’t realise how much digital systems govern access to our basic public services, like education, health and housing. Even more terrifying is how much data is collected about us and used without our knowledge. In 2011, while advocating for broadband adoption policies, Dr Seeta Peña Gangadharan began asking questions about surveillance, privacy, and data profiling. As she reveals a frightening picture of how data profiling works against us, Seeta highlights how people are resisting and why being a good digital citizen means rejecting technological systems that mistreat us." *Summary from video description*

# Decentering Technology in Discourse on Discrimination 
## Seeta Peña Gangadharan and Jedrzej Niklas
### 2019 

Addresses the problem of algorithmic discrimination from a perspective that decentred the tech aspect and instead employs Nancy Fraser's theory of abnormal justice "which highlights interconnections between maldistribution of economic benefits, misrecognition of marginalized communities, and their misrepresentation in political processes." Uses 30 interviews with civil society representatives in Europe's human rights sector to clarify this idea of decentering.

# Dirty Data, Bad Predictions: How Civil Rights Violations Impact Police Data, Predictive Poliving Systems, and Justice
## Rashida Richardson, Jason M. Schultz and Kate Crawford
### 2019 

The researchers looked at how predictive policing systems, which use prior police collected data to forecast criminal activity and allocate resources, are affected by the "dirty policing" and "dirty data" practices of police forces prior: namely, the skewing of data for crime to appear reduced, extortative methods, planting evidence on innovent people etc. which were known policies of many major police departments in America.  By looking at case studies where predictive policing tools were implemented in Chicago, New Orleans and Maricopa Country, the researchers show that there is insufficient account taken of dirty data affecting and perpetuating biased police practices.  Thus, "the use of predictive policing must be treated with high levels of caution and mechanisms for the public to know, access, and reject such systems"

Dives deep into the subject of content moderation on social media, and the idea that what protects us from seeing innapropriate things on social media is computer algorithms - when really, more than 100,000 people are hired to moderate content on social media, sometimes outsourced to other countries like the Phillipines or in Silicon Valley.  An ethnographic account of these workers lives.

# The Joys of Standards
## Andrew Russell and Lee Vinse
### 2019

The authors discuss the societal benefits of standardization, and examples of where the creation of standards have been a cooperative process, involving many parties, that worked to forge more coorporation and convenience after the standard was used. They wish to push back on the idea that standardization is stifling, Kafka-esque, mediocre and comformist, as well as push back on the idea that "innovation," newness and reinventing prior standards is inherently good, to show that standards are joyful for the creators and consumers of technology alike.

# The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity
## Amy Webb
### 2019

The big nine corporations -- Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, Microsoft, IBM and Apple--are the new gods of AI and are short-changing our futures to reap immediate financial gain. In this book, Amy Webb reveals the pervasive, invisible ways in which the foundations of AI -- the people working on the system, their motivations, the technology itself -- is broken. Within our lifetimes, AI will, by design, begin to behave unpredictably, thinking and acting in ways which defy human logic. The big nine corporations may be inadvertently building and enabling vast arrays of intelligent systems that don't share our motivations, desires, or hopes for the future of humanity.

# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power
## Shoshana Zuboff
### 2019 

Zuboff tackles the social, political, business, personal, and technological meaning of "surveillance capitalism" as an unprecedented new market form. It is not simply about tracking us and selling ads, it is the business model for an ominous new marketplace that aims at nothing less than predicting and modifying our everyday behavior-- where we go, what we do, what we say, how we feel, who we're with. She shows that the threat has shifted from a totalitarian "big brother" state to a universal global architecture of automatic sensors and smart capabilities, free from democratic oversight and control.

# Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need 
## Sasha Constanza-Chock
### 2020

This book explores the theory and practice of design justice, demonstrates how universalist design principles and practices erase certain groups of people—specifically, those who are intersectionally disadvantaged or multiply burdened under the matrix of domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and settler colonialism)—and invites readers to “build a better world, a world where many worlds fit; linked worlds of collective liberation and ecological sustainability.” Along the way, the book documents a multitude of real-world community-led design practices, each grounded in a particular social movement. Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity in the technology and design professions; it connects design to larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological survival. *Summary taken from MIT Press*

She analyzes why some computer-based personal assistants are gendered female, others male, and how these gender constructions reify the gender binary and represent cultural attitudes towards embodiment and computer anthropomorphism. The Computer's Voice "breaks new ground in questions surrounding media, technology, and gender. It makes important contributions to conversations around the gender gap and the increasing acceptance of transgender people."

## Magdalena Olszanowski
### 2020

Philosophical history of the early internet (1996-2001) from the perspective of women who were using nascent internet technology to share feminist ideas, art, etc. Challenges the typical early history of the internet (a field which is growing as we speak), a history which in and of itself is hard to trace because much of the early internet is erased or forgotten.  Dominant narratives focus on white male entrepreneurs capitalizing off of the internet rather than women who used "proto-social media" to self-imag(in)e which ultimately "reshape a feminist intimate public into a new genre of friendship predicated on the aesthetics and forms of circulation of the work." Draws from feminist cyberculture, feminist phenomenology and affect theory.

# When Proof Is Not Enough

Article written re: 2020 police protests questionning whether data itself, or in this case video documentation is enough to spark societal empathy and change.  Onuoha uses their background in teaching data-collection to demonstrate that even when historically and experimentally, people are confronted with documentation which contradicts the belief systems of individuals, automatic acceptance of the truth is seldom the result.  Therefore, video of police brutality alone, has its limits in pushing for racial justice.

# Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto

### 2020

"The divide between the digital and the real world no longer exists: we are connected all the time. How do we find out who we are within this digital era? Where do we create the space to explore our identity? How can we come together and create solidarity?
The glitch is often dismissed as an error, a faulty overlaying, but, as Legacy Russell shows, liberation can be found within the fissures between gender, technology and the body that it creates. The glitch offers the opportunity for us to perform and transform ourselves in an infinite variety of identities. In Glitch Feminism, Russell makes a series of radical demands through memoir, art and critical theory, and the work of contemporary artists who have travelled through the glitch in their work." *Quoted from summary*

"Crawford reveals how the global networks underpinning AI technology are damaging the environment, entrenching inequality, and fueling a shift toward undemocratic governance. She takes us on a journey through the mining sites, factories, and vast data collections needed to make AI ""work"" — powerfully revealing where they are failing us and what should be done.

While technical systems present a veneer of objectivity and neutrality, Crawford shows how they are designed to serve and intensify existing systems of power. Drawing on a decade of original research, she shows how the new infrastructures of AI reflect the beliefs and perspectives of a small group of people and serve the interests of the few at the expense of the many." *Summary taken from author's website*

# Flash Forward: An Illustrated Guide to Possible and Not So Possible Tomorrows
## Rose Eveleth 
### 2021

This book "takes readers on a journey from speculative fiction to speculative “fact.” Producer and host of the podcast Flash Forward, Rose Eveleth poses provocative questions about our future, which are brought to life by 12 of the most imaginative comics and graphic artists at work, including Matt Lubchanksy, Sophie Goldstein, Ben Passmore, and Box Brown. Each artist chooses a subject close to their heart—Ignatz Award nominee Julia Gfrörer, for instance, will imagine a future in which robots make art—and presents their chosen future in their own style. Drawing on her interviews with experts in various fields of study, Eveleth will then report on what is complete fantasy and what is only just out of reach in insightful essays following the comics. This book introduces compelling visions of the future and vividly explores the human consequences of developing technologies. Flash Forward reveals how complicated, messy, incredible, frightening, and strange our future might be." *Quoted from website*
