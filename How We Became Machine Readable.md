# How We Became Machine Readable
## Mimi Onuoha
### 2017 

In this talk, Mimi Onuoha discusses how data sets should be intrinsically tied to the data collection process, and how data that claims to represent a whole set of people or things often systematically exclude outliers or variants. Namely, Onuoha discusses the Middletown, Muncie ID case where two researchers collected large swathes of social data to represent the "average american town" and thus america as a whole, while excluding immigrants and african americans in the study.  She also discusses her catcaller experiment, her study wth Fulbright-Nat Geo where she tracked the location data of four groups of participants intimately to tell stories, and the missing datasets project, focusing on the data collection process.
