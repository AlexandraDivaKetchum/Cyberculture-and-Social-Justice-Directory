# Hail the Maintainers
## Andrew Russell
### 2016

A historically mindful article critiquing the rhetoric of innovation, and upholding the importance of the unglamorous labour of technology maintenance.  For Russel, since post-WW2, "innovation" has become a buzzword that originally stemmed from the replacement of the word progress as a less political, less ethically bound version of technoutopianism.  From there, we see that innovation rhetoric, creating new bigger systems to drastically overhaul the status quo, is pervasive and yet, not realistically bound as the majority of the technologies we use as humans hold up and need to be maintained.  Thus, rather than looking toward the 1% of "innovators," we should centre the large numbers of "maintainers" who ensure that our current infrastructure continue to run.
