# Broad Band : The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet
## Claire Lisa Evans
### 2018

The historical biographies of women who played a big role in the development of technology and internet, including Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Elizabeth (Jake) Feinler and Stacy Horn. "In a world where tech companies are still male-dominated and women are often dissuaded from STEM careers, Broad Band shines a much-needed light on the bright minds history forgot, from pioneering database poets, data wranglers, and hypertext dreamers to glass ceiling-shattering dot com-era entrepreneurs."
