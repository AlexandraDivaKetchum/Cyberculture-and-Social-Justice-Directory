# The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation After the Genome
## Alondra Nelson
### 2016

"Social commentary and critique of DNA genome testing, particularly for African American people. "DNA-based techniques are being used in myriad ways, including grappling with the unfinished business of slavery: to foster reconciliation, to establish ties with African ancestral homelands, to rethink and sometimes alter citizenship, and to make legal claims for slavery reparations specifically based on ancestry." *Summary from Penguin Random House*
