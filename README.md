# Cyberculture-and-Social-Justice-Directory
This is where the markdown sheets for the Cyberculture and Social Justice Directory live. 
There is information on how we are coding the information for consistency. 
The project is public so that folks can access the directory in a raw file form. This is done for accessibility and for preservation purposes.
